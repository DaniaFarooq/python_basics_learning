# 🐍 Python Basics – My Journey to Mastery

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my journey of mastering Python — the foundation of my mission to become a **top-tier Data Scientist**. This repository is not just code, it’s a guide, a set of notes, and a resource for anyone who wants to start strong in Python.

## 🌟 What You’ll Find Here
- Beginner-friendly Python code examples  
- Concepts explained in simple words  
- Practical tips & tricks to write cleaner, faster Python  
- Interesting Python facts and hidden features  
- Mini challenges & exercises to test your understanding  

## 🛤️ My Learning Journey
This repository reflects my learning path step by step.  
I started with the **absolute basics** and am steadily building towards advanced data science.  
You’ll find each section organized so you can learn alongside me:

1. **Python Setup & Environment** – Installing Python, IDEs, and first scripts  
2. **Core Syntax** – Variables, data types, operators  
3. **Control Flow** – If/else, loops, and writing efficient logic  
4. **Functions & Modules** – Reusable code and Python’s standard library  
5. **Data Structures** – Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
6. **Error Handling** – Debugging and writing safe programs  
7. **Object-Oriented Programming** – Classes, objects, inheritance  
8. **Data Science Foundations** – Libraries like NumPy, pandas, and first analytics projects  


## 🚀 How to Use
